# Smart Public Maintenance Reporting System

This is a full stack web application designed to help citizens report public maintenance issues such as road damage, garbage, water leakage, and streetlight problems.

## Machine Learning Module
The system uses a Sentiment Analysis model to analyze public comments and feedback.  
Based on sentiment (positive, negative, neutral), the system helps authorities understand problem severity and suggests areas where improvements are needed.

(Project implementation will be added in future phases.)
